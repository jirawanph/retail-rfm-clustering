# Insight
- Cluster 1: At Risk or Dormant — long time no purchase, low spend
- Cluster 2: Loyal Regulars — moderate frequency and spend
- Cluster 3: VIPs — high value and recent activity


# Insight Summary

- **Cluster 1** (Dormant): Needs reactivation campaign
- **Cluster 2** (Moderate): Upsell with loyalty incentives
- **Cluster 3** (VIP): Retain & engage with premium experiences

# Real-World Strategies

| Cluster | Strategy | Tools |
  |--------|----------|-------|
  | Dormant | Win-back offer | Mailchimp, Facebook Ads |
  | Moderate | Loyalty upgrade | CRM, Loyalty Tools |
  | VIP | Exclusive invite | LINE OA, Referral Tools |
  
  # Key Takeaway
  
  K-means enables segmentation without relying on static rules, letting the data reveal behavioral groups naturally.
